# Regression Analysis on Gene Expression Data

## Overview
This project focuses on performing **regression analysis** using gene expression data from the **NCI60 dataset**. The NCI60 dataset contains gene expression profiles for 60 cancer cell lines derived from 9 different cancer types. The goal is to analyze the relationship between specific genes (`G4701` and `G4700`) and cancer types using **linear regression**.

The project includes:
1. **Regression on the Full Dataset**: Training and evaluating a regression model on the entire dataset.
2. **Regression with Training/Testing Split**: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
3. **Visualization**: Creating heatmaps and scatter plots to interpret the results.

## What is Linear Regression?
Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a **dependent variable** (target) and one or more **independent variables** (features). It assumes a linear relationship between the input variables and the output variable, and its goal is to find the best-fit line that minimizes the difference between observed and predicted values.

ðŸ’¡ **Formula for Simple Linear Regression:**
\[ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \varepsilon \]
- \( Y \) = Target (dependent variable)
- \( X_1, X_2 \) = Predictor variables (independent variables, in this case, gene expression levels of `G4701` and `G4700`)
- \( \beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2 \) = Regression coefficients
- \( \varepsilon \) = Error term

### **Limitations of Linear Regression**
- **Assumption of Linearity**: Linear regression assumes that the relationship between variables is linear, which may not be the case for complex biological data.
- **Overfitting**: When too many features are used without proper regularization, the model may perform well on training data but poorly on unseen data.
- **Limited Feature Selection**: Only two genes (`G4701` and `G4700`) were used in this model. Additional relevant genes might provide a more comprehensive prediction.
- **Sensitive to Outliers**: Large variations in certain gene expression levels could skew the model and affect the regression line.

## Why Use `G4701` and `G4700`?
These two genes were selected for the regression analysis based on their potential role in cancer classification. The decision to focus on `G4701` and `G4700` was made to:
- **Simplify the Model**: Using only two genes allows us to visualize relationships more easily.
- **Avoid Overfitting**: Adding too many genes can lead to a more complex model that does not generalize well to new data.
- **Test Predictive Power**: Investigate whether just two genes can provide meaningful predictions about cancer type.

However, we could have used other genes by applying **feature selection techniques** such as:
- **Variance Thresholding**: Selecting genes with the highest variance.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Choosing genes that correlate most with cancer type.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reducing dimensionality while preserving variance.

## Dataset
The dataset contains:
- **Rows**: 60 cancer cell lines.
- **Columns**:
  - `CellLine`: Unique identifier for each cell line.
  - `CancerType`: The type of cancer (e.g., BREAST, CNS, COLON, etc.).
  - Gene expression data for thousands of genes.

For regression analysis, we focus on:
- **Independent Variables (Features)**: Gene expression levels of `G4701` and `G4700`.
- **Dependent Variable (Target)**: `CancerType` (one-hot encoded for multinomial regression).

## Regression on the Full Dataset

### 1. Model Training
We trained a **linear regression model** on the entire dataset using the `lm()` function in R.

```R
model <- lm(target ~ G4701 + G4700, data = df)
coef(model)
```

### 2. Prediction
Using the trained model, we predicted the probabilities for each cancer type.

```R
predicted_probabilities <- predict(model, newdata = df, type = "probs")
```

### 3. Visualization
We created visualizations to interpret the results:
- **Heatmap of Predicted Probabilities**: Shows the predicted probabilities for each cancer type.
- **Scatter Plot with Regression Line**: Visualizes the relationship between `G4701` and `G4700` expression levels, colored by cancer type.

```R
# Scatter plot with regression line
ggplot(df, aes(x = G4701, y = G4700, color = CancerType)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8, size = 5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "black", se = TRUE, linetype = "dashed") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  labs(title = "Relationship Between G4701 and G4700",
       subtitle = "Colored by Cancer Type with Regression Line",
       x = "G4701 Expression",
       y = "G4700 Expression",
       color = "Cancer Type") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Regression with Training/Testing Split

### 1. Splitting the Dataset
To evaluate the model's performance on unseen data, we split the dataset into **training** and **testing sets** (80% training, 20% testing).

```R
set.seed(123)
train_data <- df %>% group_by(CancerType) %>% sample_frac(0.8) %>% ungroup()
test_data <- df %>% anti_join(train_data, by = "CellLine")
```

### 2. Model Training
We trained a **linear regression model** on the training set:

```R
model <- lm(train_target ~ G4701 + G4700, data = train_data)
```

### 3. Prediction on the Testing Set
Using the trained model, we predicted the probabilities for each cancer type on the **testing set**.

```R
predicted_probabilities <- predict(model, newdata = test_data, type = "probs")
```

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of linear regression to analyze the relationship between gene expression levels and cancer types. While the model provides insights, it also highlights the limitations of linear regression. Future work could involve:
- **Using More Genes**: Expanding the feature set to improve predictive power.
- **Exploring Non-Linear Models**: Considering machine learning techniques like decision trees or neural networks.
- **Applying Regularization**: Techniques like Ridge or Lasso regression could help mitigate overfitting.
