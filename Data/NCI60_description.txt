NCI-60 Dataset Description

The NCI-60 dataset is a well-known collection of data from 60 human cancer cell lines, established by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). It is widely used for cancer research, drug discovery, and machine learning applications in bioinformatics.

Overview

The dataset includes 60 different cancer cell lines derived from 9 distinct cancer types.

It has been extensively used in studies related to drug sensitivity, gene expression, proteomics, and metabolomics.

The data is valuable for understanding cancer biology, predicting drug responses, and developing computational models for precision medicine.

Cancer Types Included

The NCI-60 dataset consists of cell lines originating from various types of cancer, including:

Breast Cancer

CNS (Central Nervous System) Cancer

Colon Cancer

Leukemia

Melanoma

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

Ovarian Cancer

Prostate Cancer

Renal (Kidney) Cancer

Data Features

Depending on the version of the dataset, the following types of data may be included:

Gene expression profiles (RNA-seq, microarray data)

Drug sensitivity measurements (e.g., GI50, IC50 values for various compounds)

Proteomics data (protein expression levels)

Mutational status of key oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes

Metabolomics data

Applications of the NCI-60 Dataset

Machine Learning & Classification: The dataset is often used to develop predictive models for cancer classification and drug response.

Biomarker Discovery: Researchers use it to identify genes and proteins associated with different cancer types.

Drug Screening & Precision Medicine: The dataset provides drug response data, aiding in the discovery of personalized treatment strategies.
