# NCI-60 Dataset Description

The **NCI-60** dataset is a well-known collection of data from **60 human cancer cell lines**, established by the **National Cancer Institute (NCI)**. It is widely used for cancer research, drug discovery, and machine learning applications in bioinformatics.

## Overview
- The dataset includes **60 different cancer cell lines** derived from **9 distinct cancer types**.
- It has been extensively used in studies related to **drug sensitivity, gene expression, proteomics, and metabolomics**.
- The data is valuable for understanding cancer biology, predicting drug responses, and developing computational models for precision medicine.

## Cancer Types Included
The NCI-60 dataset consists of cell lines originating from various types of cancer, including:

- **Breast Cancer**
- **CNS (Central Nervous System) Cancer**
- **Colon Cancer**
- **Leukemia**
- **Melanoma**
- **Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer**
- **Ovarian Cancer**
- **Prostate Cancer**
- **Renal (Kidney) Cancer**

## Data Features
The dataset includes a variety of biological and molecular data types, such as:

- **Gene expression profiles** (RNA-seq, microarray data)
- **Drug sensitivity measurements** (e.g., GI50, IC50 values for various compounds)
- **Proteomics data** (protein expression levels)
- **Mutational status of key oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes**
- **Metabolomics data**

## Applications of the NCI-60 Dataset
- **Machine Learning & Classification**: Used to develop predictive models for cancer classification and drug response.
- **Biomarker Discovery**: Helps identify genes and proteins associated with different cancer types.
- **Drug Screening & Precision Medicine**: Provides drug response data to support personalized treatment strategies.
