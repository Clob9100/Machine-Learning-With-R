# Introduction to Machine Learning with R

Machine learning can seem intimidatingâ€”until you understand its foundations. If you have a basic grasp of coding principles, this introductory guide will help you build a solid understanding of machine learning concepts. 

Using the **R programming language**, you will start by learning **regression modeling**, then progress to more advanced topics such as **neural networks** and **tree-based methods**. Finally, you will dive into practical applications using the **caret** package in R. 

By the end of this guide, you will be comfortable working with **regression and classification models**, enabling you to tackle a wide range of machine learning problems.

## ðŸ“Œ What You'll Learn
- Explore the **fundamentals of machine learning**, including models, algorithms, and data training.
- Understand **supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms**.
- Learn key **statistical concepts** for data preparation and model building.
- Dive into **linear regression models** used in data science.
- Work with **single-layer and multi-layer neural networks** to compute outputs.
- Discover how **tree-based models** and **decision trees** operate.
- Get a **comprehensive view of the machine learning ecosystem in R**.
- Leverage the **powerful tools available in the `caret` package** for model training and evaluation.

## ðŸ›  Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of **R programming**.
- Familiarity with **data manipulation** and **statistics** is helpful but not required.

This README:
- **Uses GitHub-friendly formatting** (sections, bullet points, and code blocks).
- **Clearly outlines learning goals**.
- **Provides installation guidance** for caret.
- **Encourages contributions**.
